# Tic Tac Toe

Assignment A4 for the course CS F314

This is a starter code for the Tic Tac Toe multiplayer game app assignment.

It uses Android Navigation Component, with a single activity and three fragments:

- The DashboardFragment is the home screen. If a user is not logged in, it should navigate to the
  LoginFragment. (See the TODO comment in code.)

- The floating button in the dashboard creates a dialog that asks which type of game to create and
  passes that information to the GameFragment (using SafeArgs).

- The GameFragment UI has a 3x3 grid of buttons. They are initialized in the starter code.
  Appropriate listeners and game play logic needs to be provided.

- Pressing the back button in the GameFragment opens a dialog that confirms if the user wants to
  forfeit the game. (See the FIXME comment in code.)

- A "log out" action bar menu is shown on both the dashboard and the game fragments. Clicking it
  should log the user out and show the LoginFragment. This click is handled in the MainActivity.
